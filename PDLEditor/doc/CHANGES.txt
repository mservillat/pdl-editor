TODO
- dans module Expression, rajouter la valeur de l'expression

- new Parameter Expression and Modify 
  - for Dimension and Precision; allow integer and upon clicking OK creates the ACE 
    with automatic naming even if constant with same value already exists.
    In this case the ACE type is INTEGER and no power, operation, operand
    Implem with radio buttons:
    Dimension : [ ] menu
                [ ] champ (entier)
    Possibility to use GeneralParameter creation to check the validity: cf test.java


- idem for precision: create an ACE of type REAL vs INTEGER for dimension

    
- Service module; 
  - service ID will be a URL, make field larger to right of box 


- When deleting the last expression, the panel on the right of the expression module should be empty
